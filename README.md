# NATOABCHelper
A pet project I'm doing...with the help of ChatGPT

Disclaimer: **I'm not a developer**

This is an opportunistic experiment. I can't program for shit. I just can't do code. I can't visualize it logically in my head. I can *understand it* some code better than others. HTML? Easy. Markdown? Also easy. Python? It depends. Javascript? More or less (I have to use it for work sometimes). But aside from that, forget about it.

I couldn't identify a burning need that made me go "I can write a little program for this".

Until this past Sunday.

You see, I was helping my wife with an airline issue. And the one thing reps will always want is your confirmation code. And it's very easy to use the NATO alphabet to tell the reps this. I have an actual physical paper with the NATO alphabet taped to my office wall. But I wasn't in my office; I was on the dining table.

So while I was on the phone I asked ChatGPT to create me a Python script that would spell a set of words in the NATO alphabet. These files are the result!

So this is a work in progress. And almost a hobby at this point. I don't know where this will go. But I want to open it to the worldto see where it can go. 

The natural evolution of this would be for it to be an extension, or a tray bar app that you can call, enter your letters and out comes the pronunciation. This is a good start though. You just have to remember to open it and give it the commands. 

I've made comments in each of the files as to what they do. If you feel inclined to contribute, fellow traveler, please do so! Just remember that I don't know anything about programming myself. 

Maybe this is the intended use of ChatGPT to start you and take you in the right direction.

In any case, have fun!
